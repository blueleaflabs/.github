# Blue Leaf Labs

Blue Leaf Labs is my research initiative building reproducible, open-source work at the intersection of environmental engineering, climate data analysis, and energy systems.

This is my work on physics-based modeling, data pipelines, experimental prototypes where applicable, and with luck, some clear, verifiable outputs!

## My experiments so far:

### Climate risk & environmental equity
**HeatShield** — California-scale environmental exposure and vulnerability mapping (heat, PM2.5, smoke) with reproducible analysis notebooks.

### Hydroclimate baselines & anomaly detection
**HydroPulse** — Multi-source hydroclimate baselines and anomaly scoring across space and time (built for “beyond threshold” drought / regime analysis).

### Computational + (early-stage) quantum methods
**GradingMusic (QuantumMelody line of work)** — Feature extraction and evaluation of vocal performance; explores quantum-inspired representations alongside classical baselines.

### Competition / scenario modeling
**MTFC Scenario** — Scenario-phase modeling code used for the Modeling the Future Challenge workflow.

## Key principles that I try to follow:

- **Reproducible by default:** every repo targets a “run-from-scratch” workflow.
- **Transparent assumptions:** all indices, thresholds, and hyperparameters are documented.
- **Traceable sources:** datasets, versions, and preprocessing steps are explicitly recorded.

## Current status

Most projects are active and evolving. READMEs include:
- what the project is trying to answer,
- what outputs are currently reliable,
- what is still in progress.

## I'd love to hear from you!

If you are a researcher/educator and want to collaborate, open an issue describing:
1) your use case,  
2) the geography/dataset constraints,  
3) what an acceptable output would look like.
